# Global Disease Cause Explorer (GDCE)

## Target Group  

#### 1.	Key User Group:

•	Health professionals: Including doctors, nurses, and specialists interested in understanding prevalent causes of mortality to improve patient care.

•	Policymakers: Individuals involved in shaping public health policies and interventions based on comprehensive mortality data.

•	Researchers: Academic and scientific professionals exploring trends in causes of death for epidemiological studies and healthcare advancements.

•	Public health analysts: Those analyzing health data to identify patterns, disparities, and areas for targeted interventions.


#### 2. User Goals:

•	Insight into Leading Causes: Users seek a clear understanding of the top 10 causes of death per 100,000 individuals in 2019 to prioritize healthcare focus areas.

•	Rate Change Analysis: Understanding the rate change from 2009 to 2019 allows users to assess the effectiveness of existing interventions and identify emerging health concerns.

•	Informed Decision-Making: Users aim to gain insights that will help shape healthcare policies, allocate resources effectively, and direct research efforts towards specific health issues.


#### 3.	Visualization Type:

• Pie Chart:
A pie chart can be used to display the distribution of leading causes of death per 100,000 people in 2019. Each cause of death can be represented as a segment of the pie, with its size proportional to the percentage it contributes to the total deaths. A pie chart helps in quickly identifying the most significant contributors to mortality among the different causes. It gives a visual snapshot of the relative proportions, making it easier to see which causes are more prevalent compared to others.
Its not show on screenshots the titles of each disease distributed on the pie chart but it is actually press on information sp when you press on it the type of disease taking part in the pie chart shows up.
•	Bar Chart:
Bar charts are excellent for visualizing changes over time, making them suitable for showcasing the rate change (2009–2019) for leading causes of death across all age groups. You can represent each cause of death as a separate bar, with the height of the bar corresponding to the death rate. The bars can be grouped by year (2009 and 2019), and different colors or patterns can distinguish the causes of death. This visualization helps in comparing the change in death rates for each cause over the ten-year period across different age groups.


#### 4.	Features Enhancing User Experience:
   
•	Interactive Elements: Hover-over tooltips providing specific details on causes and rates, enhancing the user's ability to explore data points.

•	Filtering Options: Customizable filters for demographics or specific causes aid in focused analysis, catering to diverse research needs.

•	Comparative Analysis Tools: Features allowing for easy comparison of different causes or demographic groups for deeper insights and better decision-making.

•	Export and Sharing Functions: Tools to export visualizations or share them in various formats facilitate collaboration, integration into reports, and easy dissemination of findings.

•	Accessibility and Interpretation Support: Ensuring the visualization is inclusive and providing additional contextual information to aid in understanding complex data.
